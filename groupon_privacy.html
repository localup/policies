<p>The European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC (the <strong>“Directive”</strong>). The Directive applies to the European Economic Area (<strong>“EEA”</strong>). Switzerland has also established a data protection regime pursuant to the Federal Act on Data Protection (<strong>“FADP”</strong>). These regimes restrict companies in the EEA and Switzerland (collectively, <strong>“EEA/CH”</strong>) from transferring <a href="#Personal">Personal Information</a> about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such <a href="#Personal">Personal Information</a> when it is received in the United States.  To create such “adequate protection” and allow our <a href="#Affiliates">Affiliates</a>, <a href="#Vendors">Vendors</a> and <a href="#Business">Business Partners</a> to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and the FADP, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce (<strong>“Safe Harbor Principles”</strong>) with respect to <a href="#Personal">Personal Information</a> about individuals in the EEA/CH that our subsidiaries and <a href="#Business">Business Partners</a> in the EEA/CH send to us, (<strong>“EEA/CH Data”</strong>). More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and Groupon, Inc.’s scope of participation is available at <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.
